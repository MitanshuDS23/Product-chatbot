    "bot_response": "The term \"test lamp\" is broad, encompassing various types depending on application.  Here's a breakdown of test lamps categorized by their use:\n\n**By Voltage & Application:**\n\n* **Low Voltage Test Lamps (e.g., 12V, 24V):** Used for testing low-voltage circuits in vehicles, electronics, and some appliances.  These are often equipped with a probe and a clip for easy connection.\n\n* **High Voltage Test Lamps (e.g., 120V, 240V):**  Used for testing higher-voltage circuits in homes and industrial settings.  These require extra safety precautions due to the risk of electric shock.  Neon indicators are common here.\n\n* **Neon Test Lamps:**  Simple, inexpensive lamps that use a neon gas bulb to indicate voltage presence.  They're good for quick checks but don't provide precise voltage readings.\n\n* **Incandescent Test Lamps:**  Use a small incandescent bulb to indicate voltage.  They offer better visibility than neon lamps but consume more power.\n\n* **LED Test Lamps:**  Use LEDs for illumination.  They're energy-efficient, longer-lasting, and available in various brightness levels.\n\n\n**By Features:**\n\n* **Probe-type Test Lamps:** Feature probes for contacting circuit points.\n\n* **Clip-type Test Lamps:**  Include alligator clips for easier connection to circuit components.\n\n* **Multi-meter with Test Lamp Function:**  Some multimeters include a test lamp function integrated into their design.\n\n* **Wireless Test Lamps:**  Some advanced tools offer wireless connectivity for remote monitoring and diagnostics (less common for basic test lamps).\n\n* **Insulated Test Lamps:**  Crucially important for high-voltage applications, featuring heavy insulation to protect the user from electric shock.\n\n\n**Specific Examples (Brand names will vary by region):**\n\nWhile I cannot endorse specific brands, you'll find test lamps from various manufacturers at electrical supply stores, hardware stores, and online retailers. Search for terms like \"multimeter with test light,\" \"automotive test lamp,\" \"neon test light,\" \"LED test light,\" etc., to find relevant products.\n\n\n**Important Safety Note:** Always exercise caution when using test lamps, especially with higher voltages. Ensure you understand the circuit you're testing and take appropriate safety measures to prevent electric shock or damage to equipment.  Consider using insulated tools and working with de-energized circuits whenever possible.\n"

    "bot_response": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science dedicated to creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.  This includes tasks like:\n\n* **Learning:** Acquiring information and rules for using the information.\n* **Reasoning:** Using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions.\n* **Problem-solving:** Finding solutions to complex situations.\n* **Perception:** Interpreting sensory information like images, sound, and text.\n* **Language understanding:** Processing and understanding human language.\n\nAI systems achieve these capabilities through various techniques, including:\n\n* **Machine learning (ML):** Algorithms that allow systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  This includes subfields like deep learning (using artificial neural networks with many layers) and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error).\n* **Natural language processing (NLP):** Enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.\n* **Computer vision:** Enabling computers to \"see\" and interpret images and videos.\n* **Robotics:** Combining AI with physical robots to perform tasks in the real world.\n* **Expert systems:** Systems designed to mimic the decision-making ability of a human expert in a specific field.\n\nIt's important to note that AI is a constantly evolving field, and there's no single definition that everyone agrees on.  Furthermore, the term is often used loosely, and many systems labeled \"AI\" might only employ basic algorithms rather than true intelligence.  The ultimate goal of AI research is to create truly intelligent systems, but this remains a long-term challenge.\n"
